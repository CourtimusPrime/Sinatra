**Abstract**

Cinatra is a cross-platform music app built to close the gaps between streaming services.

**🎸 Create your music identity:** Build a public profile with your recently played tracks and featured playlists--perfect for link-in-bio sharing.

**🗺️ Collaborate across platforms:** Invite friends to join the aux and add songs to the queue--even if they're on a different music app.

Cinatra makes music social again, no matter where you stream.
